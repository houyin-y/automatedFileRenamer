# automatedFileRenamer
This project is used to rename files based on the data in an excel file (.xlsx).

It is a simple project for me to explore on python-based GUI, specifically Custom TKinter by [Tom Schimansky](https://github.com/tomschimansky/customtkinter)\
Thanks to him for creating Custom TKinter and making such an amazing and readable documentation. 🌠✨
